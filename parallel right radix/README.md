This is a parallel solution to the right radix algorithm. 

It contains a test class (TestClass.java) which can be used to test the algorithms speed on a random array of length n.
Compile with: javac TestClass.java
Run with: java TestClass <n>

You can also use the algorithm directly by making an instance of the ParaRightRadix class and calling the function paraMultiRadix(<your array here>).
